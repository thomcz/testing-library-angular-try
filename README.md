# TestingLibraryAngularTry

[Replace Karma & Jasmin with Jest](https://www.amadousall.com/how-to-set-up-angular-unit-testing-with-jest/) and try
using [testing-library for angular](https://testing-library.com/docs/angular-testing-library/intro/) on a simple counter
example. Also added [jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) for custom matchers to assert state of DOM.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.9.
